<p align="center"><strong>delet is an in-development, open-source bot for Discord written in JavaScript, using the Discord.js API library.</strong>
<br><strong>Please ensure you read the note about portability in this README document.</strong></p>

## Commands
A variety of commands can be found in delet, ranging from system functions to fun commands. A custom command creation system is planned for a future release, allowing users to create their own basic commands from within Discord. Please note that as this bot is still in development, many more commands are still to come.

## Music
delet boasts an advanced music system, with commands and features to make your listening experience as enjoyable as possible, through having a system that's easy to use, yet full of useful functions, such as a built-in YouTube search function, to avoid having to always find the song's YouTube link, as well as a full queueing system.

## Moderation
delet comes with a full moderation system, with even more features currently being developed. The moderation system of this version of delet will have the same moderation commands as the old delet, in addition to brand new, useful moderation commands. Both the new and existing commands will be written to be much more efficient and easy to use, as well as making them less error-prone.

## Open-Source
We're big fans of open-source here at DS Development. delet is an open-source project; which is why it can be found here, on GitHub. It is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. This bot is open source for the reason of allowing others view its code and learn from it, and also to gain inspiration for their own ideas. However, please do not directly copy entire chunks of code, as that can be considered bad practice.
However, if you wish to use any of delet's code in your project(s), you are required to credit us (DS Development). See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/DS-Development/delet/blob/master/LICENSE) file for further details.

## Self-Hosting/Portability
A project/product being open-source doesn't necessarily mean that it is portable, and in this case, delet is NOT portable. This is due to the reason that it wasn't built for the purpose of portability, and also depends on various things to work fully as your own bot, which instructions for getting things to work are not stated here. Essentially, this project is open-source for educational purposes; so that others can see how everything works. **Self-hosting is NOT supported by any means**.
If you believe you do have the required knowledge to self-host this bot, you are REQUIRED to contact us beforehand for approval. If we do allow you to self-host delet, you must give full credit to the **DS Development Group** as the original authors. Please see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/DS-Development/delet/blob/master/LICENSE) file for further information.
