## delet is an in-development, open-source bot for Discord written in JavaScript, using the Discord.js API library.

**Please ensure you read the note about portability in this README document.**

### Moderation
delet has a full, advanced moderation system currently being developed. The moderation system of delet 2.0 will have the same moderation commands as the old delet, but will also have new commands. Both the new and old commands will be written to be much more efficient and easy to use, as well as making them less error-prone.

### Commands
A variety of commands can be found in delet, ranging from system functions to fun commands, with a custom command system coming soon. Please note that as this bot is still in development, many more commands are still to come.

### Open-Source
delet is an open-source project; which is why it can be found here, on GitHub. It is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. This bot is open source for the reason of allowing others view its code and learn from it, and also to gain inspiration for their own ideas. However, please do not directly copy entire things, as that is simply considered bad practice.
However, if you wish to use any of delet's code in your project(s), you are required to credit us (DS Development). See the LICENSE file for further details.

## A note about portability
A project/product being open-source doesn't necessarily mean that it is portable, and in this case, delet is NOT portable. This is due to the reason that it wasn't built for the purpose of portability, and also depends on various things to work fully as your own bot, which instructions for getting things to work are not stated here. Essentially, this project is open-source for educational purposes; so that others can see how everything works. **Self-hosting is NOT supported by any means**.
If you believe you do have the required knowledge to self-host this bot, you are REQUIRED to contact us beforehand and give full credit to the **DS Development Group** as the original authors.
